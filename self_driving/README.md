# Self driving data

This dataset is a modified version of Paula Moraes and Felipe
Salvatore's Self Driving Data
(https://github.com/felipessalvatore/self_driving_data).

Due to the large size of the dataset, we ommit the original `.npy`
files. You can find them on the link above.

The scripts in this directory perform various image transformations on
the original dataset, such as quantization, binarization and
equalization. Some are visualization scripts to print the histogram or
save dataset samples in `.png` format.
